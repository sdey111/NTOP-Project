### Human3.6m:
##### Properties:
+ 3.6 million 3D human poses and corresponding images
+ 11 professional actors (6 male, 5 female)
+ 17 scenarios (discussion, smoking, taking photo, talking on the phone...)
+ High-resolution 50Hz video from 4 calibrated cameras
+ Accurate 3D joint positions and joint angles from high-speed motion capture system
+ Pixel-level 24 body part labels for each configuration
+ Time-of-flight range data
+ 3D laser scans of the actors
+ Accurate background subtraction, person bounding boxes

The motions were performed by 6 professional actors, 4 male and 2 female, chosen to span a body mass index (BMI) from 17 to 29. This provides a moderate amount of body shape variability as well as different ranges of mobility. The subjects wore their own regular clothing, as opposed to special motion capture costumes, to maintain as much realism as possible.
